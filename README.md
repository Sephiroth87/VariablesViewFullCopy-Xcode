VariablesViewFullCopy is an Xcode that will let you copy the full tree description of an object in the Debug's area Variables View.

##Usage
Right click any object from the Variables View and select "Full copy".
Each child will only be copied once to avoid reference cycles, if they appear again their children will be replaced by a "[...]".

##Installation
- Clone and build the project
- Use [Alcatraz](https://github.com/supermarin/Alcatraz)

Either way, restart Xcode to make it load
